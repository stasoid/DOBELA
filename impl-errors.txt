There are two types of errors that step() can produce:

1. Error in DOBELA program - invalid command sequence - eternal recursion
   step() returns false, it can be distinguished from "terminated" state by calling getstate()
   dobcon        show message and exit immediately
   dobgui        show msgbox, exit after closing msgbox
   dobweb        show error in execution status

2. Error in DOBELA interpreter - assertion failure
   It handled differently in these situations:
                 freerun                                  under debugger
   dobcon win    print message and exit immediately       break into debugger (__debugbreak())
   dobcon linux  print message and exit immediately       print message and exit immediately
   dobgui (win)  show msgbox, exit after closing msgbox   break into debugger (__debugbreak())
   dobweb        show error in execution status           show error in execution status

   Note that assert handling does not depend on build configuration (Debug/Release), always present.
