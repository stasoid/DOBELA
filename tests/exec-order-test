Unfinished: how to create problems?
      +=======+ 
     .$       .u
     1        2    this executes intuitively - first 1 hits $, then 2


      +=======+ 
     . .l     .u
     1 2      3    this executes not as expected - a dot will pass between 1 and 2 on the next cycle
                   or may be it can be considered expected?

               but... should it really be different from:

      +=======.l
     . .l     3 
     1 2        



             +++
              =
              =
          +===+.l  creates a lot of dots behind, they should be handled if we mix commands and collisions
              .u
