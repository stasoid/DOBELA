variant of tst19 - left-moving dot collides with a standing dot that has 'incorrect' direction (up)
(it is 'incorrect' because under normal conditions this situation cannot happen because left-moving dot has priority, so the up-moving dot has to wait)
it triggers different code path than tst19 because of lrtb order of processing dots
