1. Scroll position is not saved between edit/debug mode and between frames (noticable when caret is moved between frames).

2. Execution is not uniform, a lot of jerks - WONTFIX
   Tried setInterval, setTimeout, requestAnimationFrame - animation is still jerky.
   All of the above 3 functions does not work when the browser tab is inactive, that is also not what I want.

3. Editor displays multibyte UTF-8 chars as single entities, but DOBELA interpreter treats each byte separately,
   so column alignment is incorrect if such chars present. The problem is in editor only, debugger displays alignment correctly
   because each non-command non-dot byte is replaced with a space in debugger.
   For the same reason selection containing such chars incorrectly displayed when switching between debugger and editor.
